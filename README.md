Predicting OkCupid users' astrological signs using machine learning based on profile attributes.

Welcome to the "OkCupid Astrological Sign Prediction" repository. In this project, I undertake the task of defining, preparing, analyzing, and constructing a machine learning model to tackle a compelling question: Can a user's astrological sign on OkCupid be accurately predicted using other attributes present in their profiles?

My motivation stems from the significance of astrological signs in the realm of matchmaking and user preferences. By harnessing machine learning techniques, I aim to uncover patterns within user profiles that might shed light on the relationship between various attributes and astrological signs. Even in cases where users haven't disclosed their signs, our model aspires to make insightful predictions.

This repository serves as a central hub for the project's codebase, data exploration, model development, and result interpretation. Through transparent sharing of the methodology and findings, I expect contribute to the understanding of how user attributes interplay with astrological perceptions in the online dating landscape.

Feel free to explore my journey, offer your insights, or employ my methods for your own investigations. Collaboration and feedback are warmly welcomed!
